    "bio": "Hi there! I am Erarica! I've been coding for over 4 years now. I am fluent in Java, Javascript, React, Node, MySql, Redis, RabbitMQ, AWS, Cassandra to name a few. As a Full Stack developer I've worked both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their companies. My most recent work experience was with Amazon Robotics where I worked on a Co-op for 6 months. Beyond my technical skills, I'm actively involved in extracurricular activities. As a Teaching Assistant at Northeastern University, I mentored student project teams, fostering their growth and development. At Generate Build Studio, I led the Website Vision Team, overseeing recruitment, task allocation, and code reviews, while focusing on improving user experiences.",
